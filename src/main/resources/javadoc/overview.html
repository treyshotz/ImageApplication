            This API provides a javafx application for uploading images, extracting metadata,
            manipulating albums and interacting with both on a map.
            Here, one can explore and interact with other users content.
            The map provides not only viewing where the images where taken
            and relevant data, but also enables searching for specific
            locations/addresses with autocompletion.
        </p>

            Also implemented is a user system providing login and associating
            images and albums to specific users.
        </p>
        <p>
            Bundled is a pagination and sorting system providing sorted and pageable content,
            a metadata extraction tool and a generic implementation of
            an abstract repository (DAO) to mention a few.
        </p>

            Secrets required to run the application can be
            requested from a system administrator.
